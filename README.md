# clipboard-uploader-old
An old app to upload the clipboard content to pastebin and imageshack (Windows-only)
I did this project to learn about the http protocol, for this reason, I handle requests in plain text instead of using a library.

## Requirements
- Microsoft Visual Studio
- Imageshack api-key (Add it to stdafx.h)
- Pastebin api-key (Add it to stdafx.h)
